Overview Candy Clash is a HTML5-based competitive gameplay experience outside of the main Candy Crush app, designed to let players showcase their skills and contribute Gold Bars to compete for the chance to win a share of the prize pool. Accessed via the Web Hub (in development), the experience will be built in HTML5 for speed and flexibility. This allows us to experiment rapidly without disrupting core gameplay in-app. If successful and there is internal appetite, we can explore in-app integration. This initiative introduces a new utility for Gold Bars, moving beyond their traditional use in buying extra moves or lives. It taps into competitive player motivations and opens a new channel for player engagement, especially among VIP segments. We are currently at the ideation stage. To move forward meaningfully, we first need strategic alignment that this is a space worth exploring. If there’s interest, we can develop the concept further, engage relevant teams and build out a business case. Strategic Rationale The initiative aims to drive incremental monetization and deepen engagement through a fresh, skill-based experience outside the core game. It directly supports our OKRs by helping to grow MAGBU and boost VIP return rates, giving players more reasons to return, compete and stay invested in the Candy ecosystem. How it works Players access the Candy Clash experience via the WebHub, where they contribute Gold Bars to enter daily challenges. These contributions fund a shared prize pool, which is distributed based on performance. A daily leaderboard ranks all participants. As an immediate reward for participating, all players receive a time-limited booster for use in-app. At the end of each day, the Gold Bar prize pool is allocated according to a tiered structure based on final leaderboard positions e.g. 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. We can offer three distinct leaderboards with varying difficulty levels and entry cost. Higher stakes and difficulty challenges would require greater Gold Bar contribution but also offer increased reward potential. To limit time away from the main game, players will have a restricted number of attempts per day on each leaderboard. This creates a dynamic, player-driven reward structure that celebrates skill and competitive mastery! The structure can also be configured to retain a portion of the prize pool for King, supporting broader game economy balancing efforts (pending legal alignment). Example flow for illustrative purposes only (AI used to create these concepts): Why this could be successful Strong appetite for competition in CCS Player research shows high and top spenders over-index on motivations like mastery, competition and immersion, and engage with more challenges and competitions than low and mid spenders New channel to spend Gold Bars Extends the utility of Gold Bars beyond traditional sinks (moves/lives) by offering a new, emotionally rewarding reason to spend, without disrupting existing monetization loops Low risk test • Kept fully outside of the app to avoid disruption to core gameplay • Built in HTML5 for fast, lightweight development, potentially via external agencies Additional monetization path • Induced spend: Players may buy Gold Bars to enter the competitions • Increased Webstore volume: Adds a compelling reason for players to visit the web, which can support migration of IAP from to webstore • VIP reactivation: Exclusive access or tournaments can re-engage high-value players • Cross-sell opportunities: Top performers can receive offers, bundles, gift cards, or discounts on Candy merchandise Game economy balancing If structured to retain a portion of the prize pool, the experience could provide a new lever to help rebalance the current inflation in the Gold Bar economy (pending legal review) Key Considerations • Clear competition mechanic: Define a simple, skill-based challenge (e.g. collect yellow candies fastest) to ensure the experience feels intuitive and rewarding. • Low frequency by design: Initially cap participation (e.g. two attempts per day) to mitigate cannibalizing time or spend away from the core Candy Crush experience. To be reviewed depending on how the initiative monetizes. • Balanced economic model: Carefully calibrate entry cost, prize distribution, and participation volume. While no new Gold Bars are introduced directly, player behaviour must be monitored to avoid unintended shifts. • Anchored in skill, not chance: Emphasize fun and performance to build player trust and avoid any association with luck-based mechanics. • Legal alignment required: A legal review is recommended to ensure there are no regulatory concerns around gambling perception. Next steps Action Timeline Prototype development Q1 FY26 Confirm leadership alignment Q1 FY26 Initiate legal assessment Q2 FY26 Build a full business case (feasibility and commercial evaluation) Q2 FY26 If approved, pilot and evaluate key metrics Q3 FY26   Candy Clash Prototype Brief Background Candy Clash is a web-based prototype that simulates a competitive extension of Candy Crush Saga, designed to run in mobile and desktop browsers. The goal is to create a lightweight, timed challenge experience where players can compete for a share of in-game rewards. In this concept players contribute Gold Bars (in-game currency) to enter a daily challenge, for example collect as many yellow candies as possible in the fastest time. Performance is ranked on a real-time leaderboard, and the prize pool is distributed based on final standings. This prototype will help internal stakeholders interact with the concept, feel the experience and align on next steps. It will be used in live play sessions to demonstrate the potential. Prototype objectives • Create a functional, playable experience • Allow multiple users to play independently from mobile or desktop browsers • Generate real time scores and display them on a live leaderboard • Create a simple reward moment for top performers Experience requirements The prototype should simulate the following end-to-end user flow: 1. Entry screen • Candy Crush branded welcome screen • Call to action “Play now” with Gold Bar contribution • Log in with email • All players start with 200 Gold Bars on their account 2. Challenge setup • Display challenge objective (e.g. “Collect 100 yellow candies as fast as you can”) • Show Gold Bar entry cost and message saying rank top 3 to win share of prize pool 3. Gameplay simulation • A simplified Candy Crush game play allowing players to match to collect candies • Must include: o Timer visible and running during play o Candy counter showing count of required candies collected • End on challenge completion (100 candies collected) • Gameplay doesn’t need to be complex, just enough to simulate the feel of a challenge 4. Score summary • On completion show final time • All players receive a mock booster as a reward for playing (no real game linkage needed) 5. Leaderboard • Display player’s current rank • Clear communication the leaderboard closes in X hours and minutes • Option to play again if within 2 attempt limit. Playing again takes you back to entry fee to play and repeats the loop • Option to go ‘Back to Game’ which takes players back to the Candy Crush Saga app 6. Challenge close • For prototype purpose include a manual override to close leaderboard to simulate ‘end of day’ • Celebratory animation for top players with prizes for 1st/2nd/3rd winners o 1st place wins Gold Bars equivalent to 40% of pot o 2nd place 25% o 3rd place 15% Format and Expectations • Run in a browser (desktop and mobile compatible) • Hosted on a test URL • Minimal backend to track scores, store leaderboard entries and reset leaderboard between sessions (manual is ok) • Gameplay should simulate the feel of Candy Crush, replication of exact level logic is not required Visual & Brand guidelines • Use Candy Crush Saga brand assets. Visual references and mock-ups will be provided for sole use of the prototype, not to be reused or rebranded for external distribution • Tone should be playful, energetic and rewarding Deliverables • Fully playable prototype accessible via URL • Editable design files • Delivery within 2 weeks of project kick-off
